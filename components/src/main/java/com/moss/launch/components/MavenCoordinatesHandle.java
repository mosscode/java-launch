/**
 * <h2>Overview</h2>
 * <p>
 * 	A reference to a component, expressed in terms of {@link MavenCoordinates}.
 * </p>
 * <h2>Version functions & resolving Maven coordinates for launch specs</h2>
 * <h3>Introduction</h3>
 * <p>
 *   A primary goal of a launch-spec is to unambiguously identify the components needed
 *   to assemble and launch an application.  However, when a component is referenced
 *   by a set of maven coordinates that employs special function tokens (see below),
 *   those coordinates take on a certain level of ambiguity.  Recognizing this, 
 *   java-launch was designed with a particular strategy in mind for mitigating this
 *   ambiguity problem.  The following discussion outlines that strategy.
 * </p>
 * <h3>Maven Version Functions</h3>
 * <p> 
 *   A maven coordinate set consists of a variety of types of values: groupId, 
 *   artifactId, version, etc.  However, of all these coordinate types, the
 *   'version' is unique in that it can contain special tokens that invoke 
 *   special behavior when interpreted by maven's dependency resolution code.  
 *   These tokens include:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * 	<li><b>SNAPSHOT - </b> Dynamically resolves to the latest development version of the project/module.</li>
 *  <li><b>RELEASE - </b></li>
 *  <li><b>LATEST - </b></li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <h3>Build->Deploy Reproducability is Important</h3>
 * <p>
 *   When a launch-spec is dynamically produced as part of a maven build, it 
 *   is important that the resulting launch-spec faithfully communicates the 
 *   specific builds of each of the dependencies that were used at compile/build 
 *   time. Otherwise, at deploy/run-time, the deployment/launch tooling may end-up 
 *   selecting builds of the dependencies that differ from those against which
 *   the app was actually built (e.g. somebody executes 'mvn install' again, a 
 *   new build is produced by a build server, etc).  When this happens, it can lead to
 *   inconsistent results at deploy/run time as compared with compile time, 
 *   and thus lead to pesky bugs that are not easily reproducible 'in the lab'.
 * </p>
 * <h3>How Version Functions Impact Build->Depoy Reproducability</h3>
 * <p>
 *   When a maven coordinate set contains a version function, it is normal 
 *   and expected for maven to interpret that coordinate set as a reference to 
 *   various separate builds at various times and in various contexts.  This is
 *   true even within the span of a single development cycle. This is because 
 *   <i><u> these functions express a means of finding a similar build, rather than
 *   finding a specific, individual, historical build</u></i>.  Therefore, if a 
 *   {@link MavenCoordinatesHandle} that contains a version function is the only handle
 *   a launch-spec has on a given component, the information about how maven resolved that
 *   handle at build-time is not present. The result is a Build-Deploy 
 *   Reproducability problem, since the best that any code that later interprets 
 *   that handle can do is re-resolve the dependency within its current maven context,
 *   which is likely different from that in which the build was made, and which
 *   in turn will likely result in the handle being resolved to a different build from that
 *   to which maven resolved it at build-time.
 * </p>
 * <h3>The mitigation strategy</h3>
 * <p>
 *   There are multiple approaches that could be used to mitigate this problem.  Java-launch 
 *   (and it's related, dependant projects 'appkeep' and 'appsnap') is designed with one
 *   specific approach in mind:
 * </p>
 * <ol>
 * 		<li><p><b>Version function tokens are treated opaquely.  </b> java-launch and friends makes no attempt to interpret these tokens.  Instead, </p></li>
 * 		<li><p><b>Ambiguous maven coordinate sets are treated as not sufficiently ambiguous to refer to a launch
 *   component in and of themselves.  As such, </b></li>
 *      <li><p><b>They can only be used in concert with another component handle 
 *   type (such as md5, or the build-timestamp type).</b>  The combination of a 
 *   SNAPSHOT-versioned maven coordinate and a MD5 hash, provides enough information for a run/deploy
 *   tool to locate and identify a specific build from either a local or remote maven repository.
 *   </li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 *   With this strategy in mind, all the tools in the toolchain have been designed with fail-fast 
 *   behavior when they see a component that is described solely in terms of single version-function
 *   containing {@link MavenCoordinatesHandle}; Put another way,  <b>ALL TOOLS WILL CHOKE WHEN ASKED
 *   TO RESOLVE A COMPONENT BASED SOLELY ON A {@link MavenCoordinatesHandle} THAT HAS A VERSION FUNCTION
 *   SUCH AS 'SNAPSHOT' - SUCH HANDLES MUST BE ACCOMPANIED BY ADDITIONAL MEANS OF IDENTIFICATION SUCH AS
 *   A {@link BuildTimestampComponentHandle}, AN {@link Md5ComponentHandle}, ETC. </b>
 *
